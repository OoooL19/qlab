# Versions info 

<b>four_task_fmri</b>:	this experiment has 4 tasks: VSL, SSL, TSL, and LSL. Each task is located in their corresponding folder. VSL and LSL takes about half an hour each while SSL and TSL takes about 20 minutes each. Each task include structured blocks and random blocks of the same type of stimuli.<br/>
<b>dec2017_fmri</b>:	this experiment has 2 tasks: auditory and visual. Auditory is the combination of SSL and TSL, visual is the combination of TSL and SSL. There are 6 runs in each task.<br/>
<b>jan2018_fmri</b>:	this experiment has 2 tasks: auditory and visual. There are 6 runs in each task. However, each mini-block of structured and random is made longer now. So the total number of mini blocks is reduced and the length of each mini block increased.<br/>
<b>shortened_fmri -> scanner stim	</b>:	this experiment has 2 tasks: auditory and visual. There are 4 runs in each task. The exposure phase for visual has been reduced by half. The number of questions in the 2AFC is also reduced by half (16 questions).<br/>
<b>shortened_fmri -> scanner_stim_without_test	</b>:	this experiment has 2 tasks: auditory and visual. There are 4 runs in each task. The exposure phase for visual has been reduced by half. There is no test phase in this experiment.<br/>
<b>shortened_fmri -> test_session	</b>:	This includes the 2AFC tasks for the 4 experiments, in random order. Each task has 32 questions.<br/>
<b>visual_inter</b>:  a separate project that looks into whether learning performance decrease when the intervening random sequences contain the same type of stimuli (e.g. both visual-nonlinguistic) compared to the cases when the intervening random sequences contain a different type of stimuli from the structured sequence (e.g. the random is visual-linguistic and the structured is visual/nonlinguistic). This experiment has 4 tasks: letter-letter, letter-alien, alien-alien, alien-letter. Each task is followed by 32 2AFC questions.
